# ðŸŒ¾ Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System is a smart, data-driven web application that helps farmers make informed decisions about which crop to grow and which fertilizer to apply. Based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions, the system leverages machine learning to predict the most suitable crop and provide relevant fertilizer suggestions. Developed in Python and deployed using Streamlit, the project aims to support sustainable and efficient farming practices.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Recommend the best crop based on soil and climate inputs.
- Suggest appropriate fertilizer based on nutrient balance and crop type.
- Create an easy-to-use web application with real-time predictions.
- Support data-driven decision-making in agriculture.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time crop prediction based on:
  - Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K)
  - Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall
- Fertilizer recommendation based on crop and nutrient status.
- Interactive and responsive UI built using Streamlit.
- No database required â€” uses local CSV files.
- Trained ML models integrated using joblib.

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Algorithms

The following ML algorithms were used for model training and evaluation:

- ðŸŒ³ Random Forest Classifier â€“ for accurate multi-feature classification.
- ðŸŒ¿ Decision Tree Classifier â€“ for interpretable predictions based on rule-based logic.

  

## âœ… Conclusion

This project bridges the gap between modern data science and traditional agriculture by providing a simple yet powerful solution for crop and fertilizer selection. With real-time predictions, easy-to-use interface, and reliable machine learning models, the Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System empowers farmers and agricultural stakeholders to make better, faster, and smarter decisions. Whether you're a student, researcher, or farmer â€” this tool is a step toward more sustainable and intelligent farming.

We believe that technology can transform agriculture, and this project is a small but meaningful contribution toward that vision. ðŸŒ±
